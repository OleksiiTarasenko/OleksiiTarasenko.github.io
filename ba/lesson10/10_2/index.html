          <h1>Like Tears in Rain</h1>
          <h3>Where am I going? How long have I got?</h3>
          <p>I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.
            I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. 
            All those moments will be lost in time... like tears in rain... <span>Time to die.</span>
          </p>
          <p>I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more
            than he ever had before. Not just his life - anybody's life; my life.
            All he'd wanted were the same answers...
